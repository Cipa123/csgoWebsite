# Project II Hypnogogic Stage (TOP SECRET)
Skeleton stage of development...

**PLEASE ADVISE**

There are three levels of security clearance, with the highest level being Top Secret. Secret is the next level of clearance and Confidential is the final.

This is a Confidential software platform that will be used on patience that show high frequency and amplitudes of the delta and gamma wave ocilations, most associated with the paralized state in sleep. When conciessness is induced, the hypnagogic state, during the onset of sleep is active. Mental phenomena that occur during this "threshold consciousness" phase include lucid thought, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.

Medical Records (MOST RECENT):

"Case Number: 196 

Patient: EDDIE GLUSKIN 

Consultation Dated: 2013.06.09  

Initial Date of Patient Consult: 2013.02.14

Patient Age: 46 

Gender: Male 

Observing Physicians: Dr. Jhan Teoli and Dr. Mykolas Cipa

THERAPY STATUS:

Lucid dreaming figures remain as murky as ever; Gluskin claims near constant control of his dream state, yet correspondence between his narrative and REM cycles. Highly arhythmic REM/NREM. Morphogenic Engine activity plateaus at 90 PPM.

DIAGNOSTICS:

Heavy bronchial accumulation. The rashes associated with hormone therapy have receded and vanished since we stopped using latex tubing.

INTERVIEW NOTES:

Gluskin remains a frustrating interview subject; he's still trying to tell us what he thinks we want to hear, while studiously avoiding certain elements of the truth. His childhood remains an obvious fiction, he's claiming to have grown up in "Leave it to Beaver," despite a traumatically violent ongoing sexual experience that is a matter of public and medical record. When I confronted him with the photographs his father and uncle took, he responded with a mixture of laughter and anger, and restraints were issued.

He similarly refuses to discuss his victims, both categorically and specifically. When I showed him pictures of the women, he would not admit that they were dead or mutilated.

He is still claiming advancement in the Morphogenic Engine program that he has not yet achieved, said that he could clearly hear the voice of the Walrider just by closing his eyes. Clearly he's still trying to curry the favor of his doctors. I won't speculate what he expects to gain by it."
